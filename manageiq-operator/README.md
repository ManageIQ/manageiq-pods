# ManageIQ Operator

This operator manages the lifecycle of ManageIQ application on a OCP4 cluster.


## Running ManageIQ under operator control.

There are five high level steps for running ManageIQ under operator control:

  + Step 1. Deploy the ManageIQ Custom Resource Definition (CRD) (If it is not already.)
  + Step 2. Ensure that you have a namespace to deploy in
  + Step 3. Set up RBAC
  + Step 4. Run The Operator
  + Step 5. Perform any optional custom configurations
  + Step 6. Run ManageIQ by creating the Custom Resource (CR)

The details of the five steps are as follows:

### Step 1. Deploy the ManageIQ Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

The ManageIQ CRD needs to be defined on the cluster.  If it is already available it does not need to be created again.

To determine if it is already available execute command:

```bash
$ oc get crds | grep manageiqs.manageiq.org
```

If it is not already available it can be deployed with command:

```bash
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/manageiq.org_manageiqs_crd.yaml
```

### Step 2. Ensure that you have a namespace to deploy in

If you don't already have a namespace to deploy into, you'll want to create one now.  It's a good idea to deploy ManageIQ in its own namespace, although it can share a namespace if desired.

Use the following command to create a new namespace:

```bash
$ oc new-project manageiq
```

### Step 3. Set up RBAC

```bash
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
```

### Step 4. Run The Operator

There are three different ways the operator can be run.


+ #### Option 1: Run the latest ManageIQ Operator image from the registry in the cluster

  The default in the operator.yaml is for the latest manageiq-operator image.
  So no change is required. Simply create the operator.

  ```bash
  $ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml
  ```

+ #### Option 2: Run your own custom ManageIQ image inside the Cluster

  1 - Build your operator image:

    ```bash
    $ operator-sdk build docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-operator:latest
    ```

  2 - Push your new custom image to the registry:

    ```bash
    $ docker push docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-operator:latest
    ```

  3 - Update the operator deployment yaml file with your custom image:

    ```bash
    $ sed -i 's|docker.io/manageiq/manageiq-operator:latest|docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-operator:latest|g' deploy/operator.yaml
    ```

  4 - Run your custom image from the registry:

    ```bash
    $ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml
    ```

+ #### Option 3: Run locally (on your local laptop/computer, outside of the cluster)

  ```bash
  $ operator-sdk run --local --namespace=<your namespace>
  ```

### Step 5. Perform any optional custom configurations

see the *Customizing the installation* section below

### Step 6. Run ManageIQ by creating the Custom Resource (CR)

```bash
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml
```

# Further Notes:

## Creating an Operator Bundle

To create the bundle image and push it to an image registry do:

```
$ operator-sdk bundle create docker.io/example/manageiq-bundle:0.0.1 --image-builder podman --directory deploy/olm-catalog/manageiq-operator/0.0.1/ --channels alpha --default-channel alpha
$ podman push docker.io/example/manageiq-bundle:0.0.1
```

## Customizing the installation

### Configuring external Postgres

See [official documentation](https://www.manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/installing_on_kubernetes/index.html#external-postgresql)

### Configuring external messaging

ManageIQ can be run with an external messaging server. To do this, create the required OpenShift secret with the correct parameters using the template for [messaging](/templates/app/kafka-secrets.yaml) and provide those secret names as `kafkaSecret` in `manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml`.

### Creating custom TLS secret

If you want to use a custom TLS certificate, one can be created with:

```bash
oc create secret tls tls-secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key` and setting the secret name as `tlsSecret` in `manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml`.
```

### Configuring an image pull secret

If authentication is required in order to pull the images, a secret containing the credentials needs to be created.
If your secret is named `image-pull-secret`, no additional changes are required to the custom resource.
If you use a different name for the secret, that will need to be defined in the custom resource as `imagePullSecret: your-secret-name`

### Configuring the application domain name

Modify `deploy/crds/manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml` as follows:

**Note:** The domain here will work for a Code Ready Containers cluster. Change it to one that will work for your environment.
Additional parameters are available and documented in the Custom Resource Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: manageiq.org/v1alpha1
kind: ManageIQ
metadata:
  name: miq
spec:
  applicationDomain: "miqproject.apps-crc.testing"
```

### Configuring OpenID-Connect Authentication

To run ManageIQ with OpenID-Connect Authentication, include these steps at **Step 5. Perform any optional custom configurations** from above.

For this example we tested with Keycloak version 11.0

+ Create a secret containing the OpenID-Connect's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`

You pick the name for `<name of your openshift client secret>`
The values for `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` come from your Keycloak client definition.

```bash
$ oc create secret generic <name of your openshift client secret>  \
  --from-literal=CLIENT_ID=<your Keycloak client ID>  \
  --from-literal=CLIENT_SECRET=<your Keycloak client secret>
```

+ Modify the Custom Resource (CR) .yaml file to identify your OpenID-Connect provider URL and the secret just created.

Here is an example of `deploy/crds/manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml` for OpenID-Connect authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: manageiq.org/v1alpha1
kind: ManageIQ
metadata:
  name: miq
spec:
  applicationDomain: "miqproject.apps-crc.testing"
  httpdAuthenticationType: openid-connect
  oidcProviderURL: https://<your keycloak FQDN>/auth/realms/<your Keycloak Realm>/.well-known/openid-configuration
  oidcClientSecret: <name of your openshift client secret>
```

### Configuring OpenID-Connect with a CA Certificate

To configure OpenID-Connect with a CA certificate follow these steps:

+ Acquire the CA certificate

Precisely how to obtain the CA certificate is beyond the scope of this document. These instructions assume the CA certificate has been retrieved and stored as a file on the local system.

+ Create a secret containing the CA certificate

You pick the name for `<name of your openshift OIDC CA cert>`

```bash
oc create secret generic <name of your openshift OIDC CA cert> --from-file=<path to your OIDC CA cert file>
```

+ Modify the Custom Resource (CR) .yaml file to identify the secret just created.

Add a line for the `oidcCaCertSecret: ` under the `spec:` section:

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  oidcCaCertSecret: <name of your openshift OIDC CA cert>
```

### Using your own images

If you built your own custom images and want to deploy those you can specify the image names in the deploy/crds/manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: manageiq.org/v1alpha1
kind: ManageIQ
metadata:
  name: miq
spec:
  applicationDomain: miqproject.apps-crc.testing
  orchestratorImage: docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-orchestrator:latest
  baseWorkerImage: docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-base-worker:latest
  uiWorkerImage: docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-ui-worker:latest
  webserverWorkerImage: docker.io/<your_username_or_organization>/manageiq-webserver-worker:latest
```

## Uninstalling

Uninstalling only involves a few steps:

### Step 1. Remove the CR that was created in Step 6

WARNING: This includes Persistent Volume Claims and secrets, so all data stored by ManageIQ will be removed.
The following command removes everything except for the operator:

```bash
$ oc delete -f deploy/crds/manageiq.org_v1alpha1_manageiq_cr.yaml
```

### Step 2. Remove the Operator deployment

If you deployed the operator using Step 4 option 1 or 2, run the following to remove it:

```bash
$ oc delete -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

### Step 3. Remove the RBAC that was added in Step 3
```bash
$ oc delete -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/service_account.yaml
```

### Step 4. Remove the Namespace created in Step 2 if it is no longer needed (optional)

```bash
$ oc delete project manageiq
```

### Step 5. Remove the CRD (optional)

WARNING: Ensure that there are no other ManageIQs running on the cluster since this is a cluster-wide change.

```bash
$ oc delete -f deploy/crds/manageiq.org_manageiqs_crd.yaml
```
