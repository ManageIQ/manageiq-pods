# Deploy ManageIQ on OpenShift

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods)
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods](https://badges.gitter.im/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods.svg)](https://gitter.im/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

**This guide will demo deploying ManageIQ in OpenShift as its example use-case but this method could actually be used in a different container cluster environment**

## Purpose

This example gives a base template to deploy a multi-pod ManageIQ appliance with the DB stored in a persistent volume on OpenShift. It provides a step-by-step setup including cluster administrative tasks as well as basic user information and commands. The ultimate goal of the project is to be able to decompose the ManageIQ appliance into several containers.

### Prerequisites:

* OpenShift Origin 1.5 or higher
* NFS or other compatible volume provider
* A cluster-admin user

### Cluster Sizing

In order to avoid random deployment failures due to resource starvation, we recommend a minimum cluster size for a **test** environment.

* 1 x Master node with at least 8 VCPUs and 12GB of RAM
* 2 x Nodes with at least 4 VCPUs and 8GB of RAM
* 20GB of storage for MIQ PV use

Other sizing considerations:

* Recommendations assume MIQ will be the only application running on this cluster.
* Alternatively, you can provision an infrastructure node to run registry/metrics/router/logging pods.

### Installing

`$ git clone https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods.git`

### Pre-deployment preparation tasks

_**As basic user**_

Login to OpenShift and create a project

_**Note:**_ This section assumes you have a basic user.

`$ oc login -u <user> -p <password>`

   Next, create the project as follows:

```bash
$ oc new-project <project_name>
```

### Add the anyuid and orchestrator service accounts to the anyuid security context

_**Note:**_ The current MIQ images require the root user.

These service accounts for your namespace (project) must be added to the anyuid SCC before pods using the service accounts can run as root.

_**As admin**_

```bash
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:<app-name>-anyuid
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:<app-name>-orchestrator
```

Verify that the service accounts are now included in the anyuid scc
```
$ oc describe scc anyuid | grep Users
Users:					system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:miq-anyuid,system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:miq-orchestrator
```

### Set up the httpd service account

#### If running without OCI systemd hooks (Minishift)

_**Note:**_ Minishift clusters are not equipped with OCI systemd hooks which are used to assist with containerized systemd deployments.

An extra SCC is used on Minishift to compensate for the lack of oci-systemd-hooks. **Please SKIP this step if your cluster is equipped with oci-systemd-hooks.**

__*As admin*__

Create the miq-sysadmin SCC:

```bash
$ oc create -f templates/miq-scc-sysadmin.yaml
```

The miq-httpd service account must be added to the miq-sysadmin SCC before the front-end httpd pod can run.

```bash
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user miq-sysadmin system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:<app-name>-httpd
```

Verify that the service account is now included in the miq-sysadmin scc

```bash
$ oc describe scc miq-sysadmin | grep Users
Users:              system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:miq-httpd
```

#### If running with OCI systemd hooks

__*As admin*__

Add the httpd service account to the anyuid SCC

```bash
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:<app-name>-httpd
```

Verify that the service account is now included in the anyuid scc

```bash
$ oc describe scc anyuid | grep Users
Users:              system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:miq-httpd
```

### Make a persistent volume to host the MIQ database data (if necessary)

A deployment will need a persistent volume (PV) to store data only if the database is running as a pod.

NFS PV templates are provided, **please skip this step you have
already configured persistent storage.**

For NFS backed volumes, please ensure your NFS server firewall is
configured to allow traffic on port 2049 (TCP) from the OpenShift
cluster.

_**Note:**_ Recommended permissions for the PV volumes are 777, root uid/gid owned.

_**As admin:**_

Creating the required PV may be a one or two step process. You may
create the initial *template* now, and then process them and create
the *PV* later, or you may do all of the processing and PV creation
in one pass

There are three parameters required to process the template. Only
`NFS_HOST` is required, `PV_SIZE` and `BASE_PATH` have sane defaults
already

* `PV_SIZE` - **Defaults** to the recommended PV size for the App/DB
  template (`5Gi`/`15Gi` respectively)
* `BASE_PATH` - **Defaults** to `/exports`
* `NFS_HOST` - **No Default** - Hostname or IP address of the NFS
  server

#### Method 1 - Create Template, Process and Create Later

This method first creates the template object in OpenShift and then
demonstrates how to process the template and fill in the required
parameters at a later time.

```
$ oc create -f templates/miq-pv-db-example.yaml
# ... do stuff ...
$ oc process manageiq-db-pv -p NFS_HOST=nfs.example.com | oc create -f -
```



#### Method 2 - Process Template and Create PV in one pass

```
# oc process templates/miq-pv-db-example.yaml -p NFS_HOST=nfs.example.com | oc create -f -
```

Verify PV creation

```bash
$ oc get pv
NAME      CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM     STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE
miq-db    15Gi       RWO           Retain          Available                                      1s
```

It is strongly suggested that you validate NFS share connectivity from an OpenShift node prior to attempting a deployment.

## Deploy MIQ

If you wish to add a SSL certificate now, you can use your cert and key files to create the required secret:
```bash
$ oc create secret tls tls-secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key
```

Application parameters can be specified in a parameters file. An example file can be found [in the project root](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods/blob/master/parameters)
The existing parameters file contains all the default values for template parameters. You can create a new file containing any customizations.

_**As basic user**_

```bash
$ ./bin/deploy <parameters_file>
```

## Deploy MIQ using an external database

Before you attempt an external DB deployment please ensure the following conditions are satisfied:

* Your OpenShift cluster can access the external PostgreSQL server
* The external PostgreSQL server must run version 10
* MIQ user, password and role have been created on the external PostgreSQL server
* The intended MIQ database is created and ownership has been assigned to the MIQ user

To use an external database, ensure that the `DATABASE_HOSTNAME` parameter is provided in your parameters file.
`DATABASE_NAME`, `DATABASE_PORT`, `DATABASE_USER`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` should also be checked and set if necessary.

## Verifying the setup was successful

_**Note:**_ The first deployment could take several minutes as OpenShift is downloading the necessary images.

### Confirm the deployed MIQ pods are bound to the correct SCC

Describe all pods and search for the pod name and scc

```bash
$ oc describe pods | egrep "^Name:|openshift.io/scc"
Name:               httpd-754985464b-4dzzx
Annotations:        openshift.io/scc=anyuid
Name:               manageiq-orchestrator-5997776478-vx4v9
Annotations:        openshift.io/scc=anyuid
Name:               memcached-696479b955-67fs6
Annotations:        openshift.io/scc=restricted
Name:               postgresql-5f954fdbd5-tnlmf
Annotations:        openshift.io/scc=restricted
```

### Check readiness of the MIQ pods

_**Note:**_ Please allow ~5 minutes once pods are in Running state for MIQ to start responding on HTTPS

The READY column denotes the number of replicas and their readiness state

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME                                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
httpd-754985464b-4dzzx                   1/1       Running   0          37s
manageiq-orchestrator-5997776478-vx4v9   1/1       Running   0          37s
memcached-696479b955-67fs6               1/1       Running   0          37s
postgresql-5f954fdbd5-tnlmf              1/1       Running   0          37s
```

Once the database has been migrated and the orchestrator pod is up and running, it will begin to start worker pods.
After a few minutes you can see the initial set of worker pods has been deployed and the user interface should be accessible.

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME                                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

## Scale MIQ

ManageIQ worker deployments can be scaled from within the application web console.
Navigate to Configuration -> Server -> Workers tab to change the number of worker replicas.

Additional workers for provider operations will be deployed or removed by the orchestrator as providers are added or removed and as roles change.

_**Note:**_ The orchestrator will enforce its desired state over the worker replicas. This means that any changes made to desired replica numbers in the OpenShift UI will be quickly reverted by the orchestrator. 

## Pod access and ingress

### Get a shell on the MIQ pod

`$ oc rsh <pod_name> bash -l`

### Obtain host information from route
An ingress should have been deployed via template for HTTPS access on the MIQ pod
When an ingress is deployed in OpenShift, a route is automatically created.

```bash
$ oc get ingress
NAME      HOSTS                              ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE
httpd     miq-dev.apps.example.com                     80, 443   56s
$ oc get routes
NAME          HOST/PORT                          PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION     WILDCARD
httpd-qlvmj   miq-dev.apps.example.com           /         httpd      80        edge/Redirect   None
```
Examine output and point your web browser to the reported URL/HOST.

### Logging In

Per the ManageIQ project [basic configuration](http://manageiq.org/docs/get-started/basic-configuration) documentation, you can now login to the MIQ web interface using the default username (`admin`) and either the default password (`smartvm`) of the password configured using the `APPLICATION_ADMIN_PASSWORD` parameter.

## Backup and restore of the MIQ database

Backup and restore of the MIQ database can be achieved via openshift jobs. Keep in mind an extra PV will be required with enough capacity to store as many backup copies as needed.

A backup volume claim is created with the first backup job run, be sure to provide an adaquate setting for the `DATABASE_BACKUP_VOLUME_CAPACITY` parameter.

### Launch a backup job

Backups can be initiated with the database online, the job will attempt to run immediately after creation.

`$ oc process -f templates/ops/miq-backup-job.yaml | oc apply -f -`

The backup job will connect to the MIQ database pod and perform a full binary backup of the entire database cluster using `pg_basebackup`.

### Check the job status and logs

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME                              READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
database-backup-18m5m3a2-zscq6    0/1       Completed     0          28m

$ oc logs database-backup-18m5m3a2-zscq6
== Starting MIQ DB backup ==
Current time is : Thu Mar 26 20:44:15 UTC 2020
pg_basebackup: initiating base backup, waiting for checkpoint to complete
pg_basebackup: checkpoint completed

Sucessfully finished backup : Thu Mar 26 20:46:02 UTC 2020
Backup stored at : /backups/miq_backup_20200326T204414
```

### Backup API objects at the project level

```bash
$ oc get secret -o yaml --export=true > secrets.yaml
$ oc get pvc -o yaml --export=true > pvc.yaml
```

The MIQ secrets object contains important data regarding your deployment such as database encryption keys and other credentials, backup and save objects in a safe location.

### Restoring a database backup

**The database restoration must be done OFFLINE**, scale down prior attempting this procedure otherwise corruption can occur.

```bash
$ oc scale deploy/orchestrator --replicas=0 # this should scale down all the worker pods as well
$ oc scale deploy/postgresql --replicas=0
```

Notes about restore procedure:

* The sample restore job will bind to the backup and production PG volumes via "postgresql-backup" and "postgresql" PVCs by default
* If existing data is found on the production PG volume, the restore job will *NOT* delete this data, it will rename it and place it on the same volume
* The latest successful DB backup will be restored by default, this can be adjusted via the `DATABASE_BACKUP_VERSION` environment variable on restore object template

### Launch a database restore

`$ oc process -f templates/ops/miq-restore-job.yaml -pDATABASE_BACKUP_VERSION=miq_backup_20200326T204414 | oc apply -f -`

### Check the restore job status and logs

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME                              READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Re-scale postgresql DC and verify proper operation

`$ oc scale dc/postgresql --replicas=1`

Check the PG pod logs and readiness status, if successful, proceed to re-scale rest of deployment

```bash
$ oc scale dc/manageiq-orchestrator --replicas=1
```

## Troubleshooting
Under normal circumstances the entire first time deployment process should take around ~10 minutes, indication of issues can be seen
by examination of the deployment events and pod logs.

## Building Images
The bin/build script will build the entire chain of images.

The script requires at a minimum the `-d` option to specify the location of the `images` directory, (`./images` if run from the repo root) and the `-r` option to specify the resulting image repo and namespace.

For example, if you wanted to build all the images tagged as `manageiq/<image-name>:latest`, you would run the following command from the repo root.

```bash
./bin/build -d images -r manageiq
```

Additional options are also available:
  - `-n` Use the --no-cache option when running the manageiq-base image build
  - `-p` Push the images after building
  - `-t <tag>` Tag the built images with the specified tag (default: latest)

Additionally the source fork and git ref for manageiq, manageiq-appliance and manageiq-ui-service can be set using the following environment variables:
  - `MIQ_REF`
  - `APPLIANCE_REF`
  - `SUI_REF`
  - `MIQ_ORG`
  - `APPLIANCE_ORG`
  - `SUI_ORG`

A more complicated example would be to build and push all the images to the quay.io repository "test" using the source from the "feature" branch on the "example" fork of ManageIQ:

```bash
MIQ_ORG=example MIQ_REF=feature ./bin/build -d images -r quay.io/test -p
```

## Configuring External Authentication
Configuring the httpd pod for external authentication is done by updating the `httpd-auth-configs` configuration map to include all necessary config files and certificates. Upon startup, the httpd pod overlays its files with the ones specified in the `auth-configuration.conf` file in the configuration map. This is done by the `initialize-httpd-auth` service that runs before httpd.

The config map includes the following:

* The authentication type `auth-type`, default is `internal`

	This parameter drives which configuration files httpd will load upon start-up. Supported values are:

	| Value    | External-Authentication Configuration |
	| ---------|---------------------------------------|
	| internal | Application Based Authentication (_default_) - Database, Ldap/Ldaps, Amazon |
	| external | IPA, IPA 2-factor authentication, IPA/AD Trust, Ldap (OpenLdap, RHDS, Active Directory, etc.)
	| active-directory | Active Directory domain realm join
	| saml | SAML based authentication (Keycloak, ADFS, etc.)
	| oidc | OpenID-Connect based authentication (Keycloak, ADFS, etc.)

* The kerberos realms to join `auth-kerberos-realms`, default is `undefined`

	When configuring external authentication against IPA, Active Directory or Ldap, this parameter defines the kerberos realm httpd is configured against, i.e. `example.com`

	When specifying multiple Kerberos realms, they need to be space separated.

* The external authentication configuration file `auth-configuration.conf` which declares the list of files to overlay upon startup if `auth-type` is other than `internal`.

	Syntax for the file is as follows:

	```
	# for comments
	file = basename1 target_path1 permission1
	file = basename2 target_path2 permission2
	```



For the files to overlay on the httpd pod, one `file` directive is needed per file.

* the `basename` is the name of the source file in the configuration map.
* `target_path` is the path of the file on the pod to overwrite, i.e. `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`
* `permission` is optional, by default files are copied using the pod's default umask, owner and group, so files are created as mode 644 owner root, group root.

optional `permission` can be specified as follows:

* mode
* mode:owner
* mode:owner:group

Reflecting the mode and ownership to set the copied files to.

_Examples_:

* 755
* 640:root
* 644:root:apache

Binary files can be specified in the configuration map in their base64 encoded format with a basename having a `.base64` extension. Such files are then converted back to binary as they are copied to their target path.

When an /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file is included in the configuration map, the httpd pod automatically enables the sssd service upon startup.

### Sample external authentication configuration for SAML:

Excluding the content of the files, a SAML auth-config map data section may look like:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
data:
  auth-type: saml
  auth-kerberos-realms: example.com
  auth-configuration.conf: |
    #
    # Configuration for SAML authentication
    #
    file = manageiq-remote-user.conf        /etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-remote-user.conf        644
    file = manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf 644
    file = idp-metadata.xml                 /etc/httpd/saml2/idp-metadata.xml                  644
    file = sp-key.key                       /etc/httpd/saml2/sp-key.key                        600:root:root
    file = sp-cert.cert                     /etc/httpd/saml2/sp-cert.cert                      644
    file = sp-metadata.xml                  /etc/httpd/saml2/sp-metadata.xml                   644
  manageiq-remote-user.conf: |
    RequestHeader unset X_REMOTE_USER
    ...
  manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf: |
    LoadModule auth_mellon_module modules/mod_auth_mellon.so
    ...
  idp-metadata.xml: |
    <EntitiesDescriptor ...
      ...
    </EntitiesDescriptor>
  sp-key.key: |
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
       ...
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
  sp-cert.cert: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  sp-metadata.xml: |
    <EntityDescriptor ...
       ...
    </EntityDescriptor>
```

The authentication configuration map can be defined and customized in the httpd pod as follows:

```bash
$ oc edit configmaps httpd-auth-configs
```

Or simply replaced if generated and edited externally as follows:

```bash
$ oc replace configmaps httpd-auth-configs --filename external-auth-configmap.yaml
```

Then redeploy the httpd pod for the new authentication configuration to take effect.

Support for automatically generating authentication configuration maps for the httpd pod is provided by [ManageIQ/httpd\_configmap\_generator](https://github.com/ManageIQ/httpd_configmap_generator). Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/ManageIQ/httpd_configmap_generator/blob/master/README.md) in that repo for further details.

## Kubernetes support

The objects created by processing the templates in this project are also compatible with Kubernetes, but template objects themselves are not.
For this reason, it is suggested to use the `oc` binary to process the templates and create the objects even in a kubernetes cluster (this is what the `bin/deploy` script does).

Here is an example of how to deploy to a kubernetes cluster using minikube:

```bash
minikube start
<edit parameters file as desired>
bin/deploy parameters
oc patch deployment httpd -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name": "httpd", "securityContext":{"capabilities":{"add":["SYS_ADMIN"]}}}]}}}}'
```

It is necessary to patch the httpd deployment because it runs systemd in the container.
In OpenShift this is handled by the oci-systemd-hooks and scc assignment, but in kubernetes we need to add the capability directly to the container.
